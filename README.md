# Template for Starting New Love2D Projects

This is my starting point for new Love2D projects. I got tired of some of the templating I was doing and will update this with new helpers and potentially libraries that make sense.

~~~~
  git clone https://github.com/tredfern/love2d-template.git my-project
  cd my-project

  # Remove the git repository metadata
  rm -rf .git/

  # Start a brand new repository
  git init .
  git add .
 ~~~~

Be aware that there is a LICENSE that is associated with this template. If your project uses a different license, be sure to change that.
